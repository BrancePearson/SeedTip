SeedTip
=======

Find your local farmers markets (U.S. only)

This script will pull data from the <a href="http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/v1/svcdesc.html">USDA API</a> and use 
the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google Maps API</a> to display the closest locations.

A basic, responsive front end is included.
